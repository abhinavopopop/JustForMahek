          <br />
          Lately, we've argued a lot, mostly my fault. I overthought things.
           I still love and miss you deeply, despite what you think.
            You mean everything to me, I can barely live without you.
             When you're with me, I feel complete. Sometimes I feel like
             I don't deserve you, you're out of my league. I know I can
              be dumb and toxic, getting emotional and possesive when it 
              comes to you, but I promise to change and work on myself.
               I won't irritate you or let my anger get the best of me.
                I'll be better, for you. One thing I want to know, 
          what's one thing you think I should change about myself, Mahek?""
          Please read it twice and EK BAR I LOVE YOU BOLDE?
